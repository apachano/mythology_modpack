# Mythology
"Players enter the world and can choose their Godly parent. The player gets certain unique actions depending on their godly parent, for example children of Zeus/Jupiter can summon lightning and push air. The player doesn't start with all actions unlocked, and their mana would start off weak (so can't summon much or for long).

The player can improve their mana and other abilities by using them.

The world should be partially procedurally generated and partially pre-made. The spawn city should be premade, and quests should be stored in schematics and then instanced for each player (so they don't bump into other players, or see evidence of other player, when doing a quest). Daedalus' Labyrinth should be procedurally generated and always present under the world. Entering the labyrinth should be a dangerous but affective way to gain experience and occasional treasures - unless you die.

When a player dies, any progress since their last save point is lost. If they're in a quest they can choose to exist the quest, in which point any progress in the quest is lost and they go back to the position they were at before the quest. Quests should be skyrim-style in that there are multiple available at a time."
